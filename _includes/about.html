<p>I am currently a Robotics Masterâ€™s student at The University of Pennsylvania pursuing an engaging career in Embedded Systems or Robotics. A Maker, engineer, and curious inventor at heart, I'm transitioning from a fast paced cybersecurity career to follow my passions in cyber-physical domains. My current employment goals are internships for the summer of 2020, but I am also open to full time employment that can work around a course schedule.   </p>
