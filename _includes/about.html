<p>Hi I'm Brian. My passions and hobbies include embedded programming, making and tinkering, and hacking at devices that interface with the physical world. I'm always looking for new opportunities to get my hands dirty or solve complex puzzles and geek out over project management that helps engineers instead of blindly driving them.   </p>
